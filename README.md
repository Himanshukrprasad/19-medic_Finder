User have to sign-in and fill out some details of the patient . And if he will search beds , oxygen he will get notified only near by hospitals, oxygen availablity around his radius of residence , he can contact at the same time. And if not available he will notified when the facilities will be available in nearby areas as well as in nearby cities.
All the hospitals and essentials covid supplier have to registered themselves and only verified can do it because we will provide a secret code only verified supplier . Supplier and hospitals can predict where the demand of medical essential will be high and where will be low with the help of our web application. All the data and process will be real time.so that no one will miss any updates and information.
